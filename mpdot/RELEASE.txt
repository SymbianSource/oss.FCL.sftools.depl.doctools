linkchecker Version 0.1.5
=========================
Added shelve support for working with large data sets. This stores everything
on the file system so uses minimal memory (10MB or so). It takes 50% longer
to read and about 12x longer to analyse (there are some obvious optimisations
that could be made in that code area however).

mpdot Version 0.1.3
===================
Added quoting on command line for directories that have spaces in them.
Added format="html" to DitamapLinkConverter converted html links for DITA-OT compatibility.


Known issues
============

Url checking
------------
Needs the proxy settings adding so that external URLs can be checked.
External URL checking has to be unit tested.

ID checking
-----------
Currently IDs are not checked that they conform to NMTOKEN constraints.

Error codes
-----------
The error codes listed in the linkchecker have not all yet been implemented.
