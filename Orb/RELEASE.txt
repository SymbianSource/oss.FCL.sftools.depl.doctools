Known issues v0.1.9
===================
Missing content
---------------
Some classes have no members. Doxygen is handling macros in implementation files but not those in #included files. 

Library and header information missing. Library information is not in Orb output. Header information would need to be resolved by first collecting all cxxFileRef
elements and then combining that to be able to create links to headers.

Some global functions in libc not appearing in final content. e.g. clearerr is built by doxygen in libc target with it's comment from the dosc file, but does not appear in the final
documentation.

Enum members missing. Appears to be partially fixed. Some documents contain the first private enum, but not the second public anonymous enum.

Misplaced content
-----------------
There is an issue with content in the wrong components. Critically this leaves some libraries empty.

Doxygen tag support
-------------------
Tags currently not supported which should be are listed below:
