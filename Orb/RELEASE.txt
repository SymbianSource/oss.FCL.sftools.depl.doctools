Known issues v0.1.7
===================
Missing content
---------------
Some classes have no members. There are approximately 1600 exported classes using the NONSHARABLE_CLASS macro. Doxygen is handling macros in 
implementation files but not those in #included files. 

Still losing whole components due to DITA-OT memory issues. This results in large groups of missing links.

Misplaced content
-----------------
There is an issue with content in the wrong components. Critically this leaves some libraries empty.

Potential issues
----------------
There are still out of memory issues in DITA-OT, which are exacerbated by the “classes in wrong components” issue that is causing the maps 
of some components to be larger than they should be.

Missing targets
---------------
Missing targets caused by command lines that are too long. Orb outputs a file (meta.xml) which outputs all the includes using echo. 
Unfortunately there is a character limit on the command line so the entire echo doesn't get printed which means that the file is invalid.
