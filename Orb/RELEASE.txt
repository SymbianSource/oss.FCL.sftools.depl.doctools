===================
Missing content
---------------

Some global functions in libc not appearing in final content. e.g. clearerr is built by doxygen in libc target with it's comment from the dosc file, but does not appear in the final
documentation.

Enum members missing. Appears to be partially fixed. Some documents contain the first private enum, but not the second public anonymous enum.

If a class declaration has more than one base class, only the first class is shown. This appears to be a limitation
in the XML.
