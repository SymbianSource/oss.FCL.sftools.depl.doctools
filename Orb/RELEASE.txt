Known issues
============

Doxygen produces a dialog box that appears under certain error conditions. 
The dialog indicates that an error has occured with doxygen and this suspends the
execution of doxygen until the ok button is pressed on the dialog.
If doxygen is being run by a continuous integration system this dialog may be hidden.
Invalid C++ is one known cause of this problem.

Doxygen has been known to take many days to run the full Symbian OS source.
It is suspected that this is due to a large amount of page faults when ram runs low.
Each doxygen process can use 500mb of ram and Raptor runs one doxygen process for each cpu.
The space required for the working directory used by doxygen is greater than 80Gb.
Please take this into consideration when choosing a build environment for Orb.
